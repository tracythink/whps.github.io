				<li id="compile">
				Compiling technical is my favorite branch of Computer Science.<br/>
				First, compile is series form , that means step 1 do not finished and <br/>
				step 2 is untouchable , needs rigorous and serious . Second, when I <br/>
				do some work, compile knowledge is applyed invisiblely. Third, the<br/>
				learning process is the essence of inquiry and To seek knowledge.

				<li id="computer">
				Computer tool, at the begining  is the calculation tool, now it<br/>
				become problem solving tools . As with other disciplines , tool is<br/>
				4 abstract and thinking what make you EFFICIENCY. 
				</li>
				<li id="turing">
				I admire the most is a computer scientist is Alan Turing. What he <br/>
				did should be marked by everyone works 4 computer . He's thought  <br/>
				is the most influential guide 4 in CS. He pointed the limit of compute  <br/>
				and whether computable in a problem, that's Turing machine.
				</li>
				<li id="tool">
				In the final analysis, our human is mission is reform the world. We  <br/>
				need tool, science and technology. Even math is tools of abstract and <br/>
				and compute. We do our best to solve the problem, but life is limited.<br/>
				Like the Chinese said: Smart people make good use of tools.

					That's a story about mkthpy: once I read about the <br/>
					amazing macros , one like this "#define stdio stdio". I<br/>
					think that is amazing enough, the reason is " C89/C99 <br/>
					say they are macros. Make them happy". actually they <br/>
					are declares of struct. In the tiny and funny story I feel<br/>
					programmer is humous, open, free and easy which let  <br/>
					me more confidence when I am coding. Now I can call  <br/>
					them "mkthpy" !
